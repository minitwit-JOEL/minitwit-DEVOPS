# Application Setup Guide

To start the application, first **setup Docker** and **add the migrations**:

## Step 1: Install Docker

First, install Docker. To create and start the Docker container, navigate to the solution directory and run:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```
or 
```sh
docker compose up --build
```

## Step 2: Add migrations
The migrations should add themselves but if they do not, please follow below:
After this, we need to add the tables in the database. First, navigate to the Api directory:

```sh
cd src/minitwi.Api
```

Then run the following line to add the migrations:

```sh
dotnet ef database update --project ../minitwit.Infrastructure
```

## Step 4: Add .env and appsettings.json files
Now we need to add a .env file with the following contents in the root of the minitwit.Web directory:

```sh
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
API_BASE_URL=https://localhost:8081/
PORT=3100
```

Next you need to add a connection string, JWT key, issuer and audience to the appsettings.json 

```sh
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": ""
  },
  "Token": {
    "Key": "",
    "Issuer": "",
    "Audience": ""
  }
```

## Step 5: Navigate to the web project
Next, navigate to the minitwit.Web project:

```sh
cd ../minitwi.Web
```

Then install the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

## Step 6: Start the project
You are now ready to start the project. In one terminal, start the Web project by running:

```sh
npm run dev
```

And in another terminal, run the backend from the API project by running:

```sh
dotnet watch -lp https
```

Or simply use the build version that docker spins up

## Test simulators with bash script

The bash script can be used to both test the simulator in development (localhost) and in production.

To test development, when standing in the root folder:

`./tests/test_sim_api.sh`

To test production, when standing in the root folder:

`./tests/test_sim_api.sh --production`
